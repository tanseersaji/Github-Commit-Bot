# Github-Commit-Bot
A Shell script that will help you create fake commits on your Git Repository.
Create fake commits and show off to your friends how "active" you are on Github.

## Usage
### Syntax
```
sh gitbot.sh GIT_REPO_PATH NUMBER_OF_COMMITS
```
* **GIT_REPO_PATH** : The path to the git repository to which you want to create fake commits. Your Github profile will show the name of this repo next to the commit.
* **NUMBER_OF_COMMITS** : Number of commits you want to push. Choose this wisely.

### Example
```
sh gitbot.sh ~/Documents/dummy_repo 6
```
This will create and push 6 fake commits to the repo associated with the "dummy repo" repository.
